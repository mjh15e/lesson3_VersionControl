            </h2>
            <p class="lead">My first highlight of lesson 3 is about version control. This system is interesting to me because it seems like it would be incredibly convenient. Version control records changes that are made to specific or groups of files. With this system you are able to reset individual parts of a project or the entire project back to a previous state. As a student that has been through coding as well as web design classes this system is attractive to me. When you are editing a complex page with lots of code and layouts simple mistakes can be a headache. Additionally, this allows you to play with different designs relatively haphazardly knowing you can revert back to a prior design with ease.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control developed in response to problems as they arrose in the community. Centralized version control developed because users needed to collaborate with developers on their system. This system offers advantages for local VCSs. Users are able to see to a certain extent what other people on ther project are doing. Administrators are also able to place controls on who can do what. This system creates a more connected space for group work making it especially effective for bussinesses. This topic interests me because it seems like an obvious next step for a system like this. Allowing this system to become more practical for businesses by enabling quicker communication between users is an ingenious idea by the developers.   </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized version control created a good base for a more connected system across local platforms. However, this system has its problems. One of the most important issues is that if the centralized server goes down no one can collaborate or save version changes. This problem is fixed by the adaptation of distributed version control systems. Clients under this system fully mirror the repository and its full history. In other words every single clone is really a backup of all the data. This is interesting to me because it seems each new version of version control radically improved its efficiency. Additionally, the improved ability to communicate with different groups on the same projects is intriguing.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Speed</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is somewhat similar to other VCSs but it has a few key differences that make it stand out when compared. One important distinction is the way Git stores its information. However, more noticably on the users side would be the speed difference. Unlike other VCSs, most operations performed through Git only require local files and resources in order to operate. Your projects entire history is right there on the local disk instead of somewhere on another computer in your network. You dont have to have to have a masters in computer science to understand that this process would be incredibly faster. The speed of this system is interesting to me because for many people waiting on electronic devices causes a measurable amount of stress.    </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Reliability</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is not only a speedy system but it is also extremely reliable and has some advantages you might not think of right away. For instance because your project history is on your local disk you can still work on a project without network connection. This is incredibly useful for users that are constantly on the move. In addition everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored. As a result, it is impossible to change the contents of any file without Git knowing about it. The reliability of this system is interesting to me because as I have learned in classes not all products can be trustworthy. In addition, the lack of network connection reliance and speed are both very intriguing.  </p>
