## Project Description:
(In this assignment we learned about version control systems. We learned about the developments of different variants of version control systems and the pros and cons of each.)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Version control systems allow you to revert your project back to a previous state using a database of saved states.)
2. (Git is an extremely fast version control system. The reason for this is because your project and the versions are stored on your local disk instead of another computer somewhere on your network.)
3. (Git can be very useful for many reasons. Having your project and its versions on your local disk means you do not have to rely on network connection to work on a project. This is one advantage over a centralized version control system.)
